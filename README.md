Fireman Assist Mod for Derail Valley

Right now this mod only protects against water issues and does so in a very naive way.  Any loco you enter will automatically get the monitor attached if it is a supported loco.

Current Features:
* If water gets below the bottom nut of the sight glass will turn off blowdown and turn on injector
* If water gets above the top of the sight glass will turn off injector.

Planned Features:
* Slope aware water management
* Water targeting a specific point in the water glass instead of full/empty
* Adding water if below the top of the sight glass to prevent safety popping
* Adding coal to keep fire going
* Adding coal to heat fire if pressure drops
* Advanced fireman behavior
* Settings to enable various levels of assist.
